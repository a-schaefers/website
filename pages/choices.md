## Excluded software

Software excluded from the official repositories. These can be packaged in personal and third-party repositories.

### dbus

The `dbus` program generates a UUID for your Linux installation which can be read by the software running on your machine. Firefox refuses to start (if compiled with `dbus`) and this file is absent, Chromium complains.

This UUID is additionally generated by `systemd`.
