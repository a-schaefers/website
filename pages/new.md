title: KISS
---

An independent Linux distribution with a focus on simplicity and the concept of "less is more". The distribution currently targets the x86-64 architecture and the English language.

Some prior knowledge of Linux (*or other UNIXY systems*) is required however, those with the capacity, the drive and the willingness to learn will see KISS as a great place to start.

## Overview

- Independent (*not based on another distribution*).
- Easily parseable plain-text package system.
- Tiny package manager written in 500 LOC (*excluding comments and blank lines*).
- All shell code passes `shellcheck`.

**Software Choices**

- libc: [musl](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/).
- coreutils: [busybox](https://busybox.net/).
- init: `busybox init`.
- services: `busybox runit`, `busybox sysvinit` or roll your own.

**NOTE**: The `init` and service manager can be swapped out to use whatever you desire.


## Package System

The package system that KISS employs is based around the concept of easily parseable plain-text files (*separated by lines and spaces*). This format allows you to effortlessly interface with the package system using any programming language or just basic UNIX tools.

### Directory Structure

```sh
zlib/            # Package name.
├─ build         # Build script (must be executable).
├─ depends       # Dependencies (usually required).
├─ sources       # Remote and local sources.
├─ version       # Package version.
┘

# Files generated by the package manager.
├─ checksums     # Checksums for the source files.
├─ manifest      # Tracked files.
┘

# Optional files.
├─ post-install  # Post-install script (must be executable).
├─ patches/*     # Directory to store patches.
├─ files/*       # Directory to misc files.
├─ nostrip       # Don't strip binaries for this package (empty file).
┘
```

### `build`

The `build` file should contain all of the steps necessary to patch, configure make and install (*`make install` in this context*) the package.

The script is language agnostic and the only requirement is that it be executable. On execution the script will start in the directory of the package's source (*there's no need to change the working directory*).

The script is also given a single argument (*equivalent to `script arg`*), this argument contains the path where the script should install the compiled files. Everything in the path is added to the package tarball and later installed to the system.

**Example `build` file.**

```
#!/bin/sh -e

./configure \
    --prefix=/usr

make
make DESTDIR="$1" install
```

### `depends`

The `depends` file should contain any other packages the package depends on to function correctly. Each dependency should be listed one per line and an optional second field allows you to specify whether the dependency is needed for the build or at runtime.

**Example `depends` file.**

```
# Comments are also supported.
perl make
zlib
```

### `sources`

The `sources` file should contain all remote and local files the package needs to be built. This includes the source, patches and any other miscellaneous files which may be needed.

Each source should be listed one per line and an optional second field allows you to specify an extraction directory for the source. The extraction directory is relative to the build directory.

**Example `sources` file.**

```
https://roy.marples.name/downloads/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-8.0.2.tar.xz
files/dhcpcd.run
```

**Example `sources` file with optional fields.**

```
https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/gcc-9.1.0/gcc-9.1.0.tar.xz gcc
https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz gcc/gmp
http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-4.0.2/mpfr-4.0.2.tar.xz gcc/mpfr
https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mpc/mpc-1.1.0.tar.gz gcc/mpc

```

## Package Manager

## Roadmap

KISS is nearing a **1.0** release and is already fully functional! The issues below relate more to overall polish, installation and documentation.

**KISS 1.0**

- Finalize documentation.
    - Website.
    - Repository creation.
    - Package manager.
    - Package format.
- Packages.
    - Split `mesa` into separate driver packages.
    - Package remaining `xf86-video-*` drivers.
- Simplify installation.
    - Finish `kiss-initramfs`.

**The Future**

- Website.
    - Add a blog to the website.
- Distribution.
    - Add support for encrypted drives.
- Package Manager.
    - Add a `USE_FLAGS` type feature.
    - Add an "alternatives" system.
