title: KISS
---

An independent Linux distribution with a focus on simplicity and the concept of "less is more". The distribution currently targets the x86-64 architecture and the English language.

Some prior knowledge of Linux (*or other UNIXY systems*) is required however, those with the capacity, the drive and the willingness to learn will see KISS as a great place to start.

## Overview

- Independent (*not based on another distribution*).
- Easily parseable plain-text package system.
- Tiny package manager written in 500 LOC (*excluding comments and blank lines*).
- All shell code passes `shellcheck`.

**Software Choices**

- libc: [musl](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/).
- coreutils: [busybox](https://busybox.net/).
- init: `busybox init`.
- services: `busybox runit`, `busybox sysvinit` or `*`.


## Package System

The package system that KISS employs is based around the concept of easily parseable plain-text files (*separated by lines and spaces*). This format allows you to effortlessly interface with the package system using any programming language or just basic UNIX tools.

### Directory Structure

```sh
zlib/            # Package name.
├─ build         # Build script (must be executable).
├─ depends       # Dependencies (usually required).
├─ sources       # Remote and local sources.
├─ version       # Package version.
┘

# Files generated by the package manager.
├─ checksums     # Checksums for the source files.
├─ manifest      # Tracked files.
┘

# Optional files.
├─ post-install  # Post-install script (must be executable).
├─ patches/*     # Directory to store patches.
├─ files/*       # Directory to misc files.
├─ nostrip       # Don't strip binaries for this package (empty file).
┘
```
