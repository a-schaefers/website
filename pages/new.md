title: KISS
---

An independent Linux distribution with a focus on simplicity and the concept of "less is more". The distribution currently targets the x86-64 architecture and the English language.

Some prior knowledge of Linux (*or other UNIXY systems*) is required however, those with the capacity, the drive and the willingness to learn will see KISS as a great place to start.
