KISS is a highly opinionated and ultra minimal, Linux distribution. Simplicity takes precedence above all. The default installation is *just* minimal enough to rebuild itself and any additional packages the user desires.

## Package System

The package system was built specifically for KISS and employs a UNIX-like file model. Instead of the typical shell script with variables, arrays and functions; this system uses easily parseable plain text files.
