This WIKI is written in plain HTML+CSS and utilizes `jekyll` to convert `markdown` files to fill the body content of pages. The theme was written from scratch and is as simple as possible while still providing a responsive and accessible layout.

Each page consumes a single web request. As the CSS is so minimal, it makes more sense to inline it on every page than to load it as an external resource. The logo in the top left of the page is a 500 byte SVG which has also been inlined.

Another benefit of this "system" is that each page is fully self contained. There's no dependence on external resources and you can easily download the pages for offline viewing.

There is no analytics, `javascript`, tracking or ads on this website. It is just plain HTML+CSS at its best. Simple, documents.
