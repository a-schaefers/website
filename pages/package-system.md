The package system that KISS employs is a new concept that came to me (*Dylan Araps*) in a dream one night. The concept is simple; a set of plain text files separated by lines and spaces. Easily parseable in any programming language or with standard tools.

## The structure

```sh
zlib/            # Package name.
├─ build         # Build script.
├─ depends       # Dependencies (one per line) (sometimes optional).
├─ sources       # Sources (one per line).
├─ version       # Package version.
┘

# Files generated by the package manager.
├─ checksums     # The checksums for the source files.
┘

# Optional files.
├─ post_install  # Script to run after package installation.
├─ patches/*     # Directory to store patches.
├─ files/*       # Directory to misc files.
├─ nostrip       # Don't strip binaries for this package (empty file).
┘
```

## Installation

When a package is installed, this entire directory tree is copied to `/var/db/kiss` where it becomes a database entry. Listing the dependencies for a package is a simple as printing the contents of the `depends` file. Searching for which package owns a file is as simple as checking each `manifest` file.
