## Why is the distribution called "KISS"?

The distribution is named after the [KISS Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle); "Keep it simple stupid".

## Why another Linux distribution?

> I was swapping from distribution to distribution looking for something minimal and simple. Not being satisfied by any of the existing options, I decided to swap to OpenBSD (*only to find that it did not support my hardware*). This pushed me to create my own distribution, reflecting my beliefs and desires.<br>- Dylan Araps (Creator of KISS)

## Why is the logo a woman?

The word "kiss" has a feminine connotation (at least in the eyes of the creator) and the logo/avatars reflect this.
