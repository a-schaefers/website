## Rationale

A Linux distribution specifically for desktop that aims to be minimal in every sense of the word. KISS is meant for users with prior Linux and programming knowledge and for those who want something simple.

The distribution is highly opinionated and the main repository will contain a minimal package set. However, as a user you can easily create your own repository and package what you like. The tools are made available to you, KISS is just the base.
