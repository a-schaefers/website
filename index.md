title: KISS
---

A Linux distribution with a focus on simplicity and privacy. The distribution currently targets the x86-64 architecture and the English language.

Some prior knowledge of Linux (*or other UNIXY systems*) is required however, those with the capacity, the drive and the willingness to learn will see KISS as a great place to start.

See the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://getkiss.org/pages/faq/) page for more information.

## Simplicity

KISS is simple in its implementation, its usage and its development. This can be seen through the tiny package manager (*500~ lines of POSIX `sh`*), the UNIX-like package format (*easily parseable plain-text files*) and the curated package choices (*`musl`, `busybox`, etc*).

## Privacy

KISS also values privacy. Packages have been chosen, compiled and patched to remove Telemetry, tracking or otherwise nasty behavior. Some "essential" packages have been excluded from the official repositories due to their nature (`dbus` for example).

Open source as wonderful as it is does not always equate to the respect of your privacy. The large Linux distributions sadly fail in this regard.
