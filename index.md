## Rationale

KISS will go back to the notion of "Linux is about choice". The major Linux distributions have all gone the way of the below post which has the following to say.

```
> Linux is about choice.

If I could only have one thing this year, it would be to eliminate that
meme from the collective consciousness.  It is a disease.  It strangles
the mind and ensures you can never change anything ever because someone
somewhere has OCD'd their environment exactly how they like it and how
dare you change it on them you're so mean and next time I have friends
over for Buffy night you're not invited mom he's sitting on my side
again.

As a consumer, yes, you have lots of choices in which Linux you use.
This does not mean Linux is in any sense _about_ choice, any more than
because there are so many kinds of cars you can buy that cars are about
choice.

Following the link and reading the replies will show a steady stream of people (many if not all of them Red Hat employees) agreeing with the idea "Linux is NOT about choice.".

The number one reason I use Linux is **for** the choice it offers (or more realistically offered) over Windows or MacOS. The ability to mix and match the software you use is disappearing steadily.
