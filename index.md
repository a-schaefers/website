title: KISS
---

A [WIP] independent Linux distribution with a focus on simplicity and privacy. The distribution currently targets the x86-64 architecture and the English language.

Some prior knowledge of Linux (*or other UNIXY systems*) is required however, those with the capacity, the drive and the willingness to learn will see KISS as a great place to start.

See the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://getkiss.org/pages/faq/) page for more information.

## Overview

- Independent (*not based on another Linux distribution*).
- Source based package installation.
- Plain text package format.
- Tiny package manager written in 500~ lines of POSIX `sh`.
- Safely written shell scripts (`shellcheck` compliant).
- Easily extendable.
