title: KISS
---

An independent LinuxÂ® distribution with a focus on simplicity and the concept of "less is more". The distribution targets **only** the x86-64 architecture and the English language.

- Independent (*not based on another distribution*).
- Easily parseable plain-text package system.
- Tiny package manager written in 500 LOC (*excluding comments and blank lines*).
- All shell code passes `shellcheck`.
- Source based.
