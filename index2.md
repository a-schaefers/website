title: KISS
---

An independent Linux® distribution with a focus on simplicity and the concept of "less is more". The distribution targets **only** the x86-64 architecture and the English language.

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”
