title: "28/08/2019: Firefox 69 now fully depends on dbus"
---

The upcoming Firefox release now depends on `dbus` and this dependency can't be disabled. The usual `--disable-dbus` `mozconfig` option has no effect.

Until this is fixed upstream or we find a way to patch this out KISS will be swapping to the next ESR release of Firefox (68.0.2 -> 68.1.0). This gives us a little over a year to sort out this situation.

With the release of Firefox 70 ALSA support will also be dropped from Firefox and we will have to ship `apulse` with KISS to fix this.\*

It seems to be getting harder and harder to run and maintain a system which doesn't follow the usual trend of software choices. Firefox even has a `dbus` dependency on FreeBSD and OpenBSD!

\*: On inspection of the Firefox 70 beta the code *seems* to still be there.
