## Highlights

### The Wiki is live

The KISS wiki is now live. The wiki is simply a regular GitHub wiki with a sprinkle of magic to automatically update the website on contributions.

- [KISS Wiki](/wiki)
- [Wiki source](https://github.com/kisslinux/wiki)

### The subreddit is open

The subreddit is now open as another means of communication related to KISS. This new communication channel compliments the IRC and GitHub well for public discussion.

## Patches

### Core

The Core repository is down to a single patch. This patch will likely never go away as the upstream for `libelf` is dead. See [nixpkgs #59929](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/59929) for more information.

```
