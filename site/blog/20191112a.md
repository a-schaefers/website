How does the KISS package manager (`kiss`) handle versions? Well, it doesn't.

I found out early on that trying to compare package versions is an error prone and overly complex problem to solve.

A package's version can be... Anything really.

- Does it follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)?
    - `1.2.11`
    - `0.14.0`
- Is it numerical?
    - `9`
    - `0.16.8.0.2`
- Is it alphanumerical?
    - `71.0b9`
    - `5.0.p11`
    - `v29`
- Is it a date?
    - `20190110`
    - `2019.2`
    - `2017-11-29`
    - `28oct2015` ([e-mem](https://repology.org/project/e-mem/versions))
- Is it a [git](https://git-scm.com/) hash?
    - `4f7617208d6c9b8ac6fae4763d0c81b25b9ac8a7`
    - `4f76172`
- Something else entirely?
    - `alpha 23b` ([0ad](https://repology.org/project/0ad/versions))
    - `6.0_ALPHA` -> `2.0_BETA5`
    - `22.40v.j1.14`
    - `v0.0.1.alpha.r0.g3e4500c`
    - `1.6.0_048_bin`
