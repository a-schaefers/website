> I just find it interesting that their version of simple includes dependency-tracking package management but excludes Spanish.

> Just wanted to say this looks kickass. It is way easier to tear things down than to build them.

> As a person who speaks Swedish, I feel that I must point out that “getkiss” translates to “goat pee.”

> I was looking for something like this actually, I thought I would finally have to warm up to BSD if I wanted an OS that I have some hope of understanding fully.

> New logo needed. The chopped off head is bad luck in parts of Asia.

> Keep making the biggest problem of Linux bigger, please... Yeah, this problem is "fragmentation", and it is not solved with "simplicity".

> "This distribution has no default desktop or window manager environment." - goes to prove that "simple" doesn't mean "easy to use"...

> Just what we need, another Linux distribution. Spread the effort even more thinly.
